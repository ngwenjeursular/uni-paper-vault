# UniVault
This is a project trying to be built to address the lack of past papers while studying for exams in University.
The primary goal of this project will be to help students from first year to their last year be able to access past papers without having to go through the unbearable pain of looking for them from lecturers, online to cybercafes around the school, will add more as the project progresses.
